            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <img src="./media/overview.png" style="display: block;margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%;" <p>
            The Insignia Collection is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software suite for businesses of all
            sizes across all industries. The suite will be a one-shop stop that encompasses a wide range of
            applications such as Sales, Financials, Inventory, databases, and storage, to name a few. In addition,
            they will provide a central point for all applications that can be bundled together for a discount, with
            an affordable monthly fee.
            </p>
            <p>The suite of applications is designed with modularity and expansion in mind, so businesses can extend
                their subscription to include other applications that will work straight out of the box as a company
                grows. This will work by utilising cloud services such as data storage so that all applications will use
                the same methods to read and write data. When the data is updated, there will be a service layer that
                can notify the other applications running, so the information is always live. The Insignia Collection
                will require an internet connection as data and subscriptions will be cloud-based.</p>
            <p>
                The suite of applications will be available across multiple platforms, accessible wherever a user has
                internet access. In addition, the suite will provide cloud-based services with a subscription-based
                payment, and as their business grows, they can add on or take away different services as the business
                demands.

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>There is a clear opportunity in for financial reward by building an ERP that aims to assist in building
                in successful businesses around the globe, with 50% of companies acquiring or upgrading their existing
                ERP systems in the near future and with 37% of ERP systems implemented requiring significant
                customization to become usable, we have the perfect window to develop an ERP system that isn’t a hassle
                to set up or maintain (Biel 2022). There are some products already that offer a comprehensive suite with
                terrific integration (a few noted below), however they usually bring the pain of expensive monthly
                pricing as well as functionality that is irrelevant to many users (Apagen Solutions 2020). The Insignia
                Collection is designed to eliminate these pains with an easy to use, modular system, with an affordable
                price point. This will allow us to not only gain financially, but to also give back to the businesses
                that give us their business, by providing them with all of the software tools they need to be able to
                grow. </p>

            <h2>Landscape</h2>
            <p>Below is a range of cloud-based applications and services marketed to different industries and audiences.
                They range in value for their monthly fees. Insignia Collection is modulated so that we can approach any
                company. After identifying its needs and concerns, we can design our package to fit their business like
                a glove. Specialising in low cost, pay only what you use, and yet fully integrated with all the services
                we offer, both current and future needs.

            <h1>Plans and Progress</h1>
            <h2>Business Case</h2>
            <p>
                As stated in the Motivation section, Insignia believe that there is a gap for an integrated application
                suite that incorporates machine learning. Our internal analysis has estimated a revenue stream for the
                proposed product to be profitable. We have determined that the initial offering will achieve enough
                revenue for the continuing development and support of the product, in addition to having enough surplus
                to grow the various teams associated with a software corporation. Initial planning and development of
                the product will require fund raising among venture capitalists.
                We would propose all members be present for presentations among Australian and possibly foreign
                investors. The Insignia team have assessed a development time of 2 years to reach minimum viable product
                (MVP). The fund has to pay salaries for the partners within Insignia, the capital expenditure, which
                includes computer, networking and storage equipment. As well as operating expenses such as rent,
                utilities and cloud services.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <!-- Aims -->
            <h3>Aims and Goals</h3>
            <p>The aim of the Insignia Collection is to offer a collection of applications with seamless integration
                through the range to offer a simple solution to our customer. By providing a single suite of
                applications we can offer products across small, medium, and large businesses with a use case for every
                industry. Listed below are the many goals we will need to clear which will ultimately result in us
                becoming the premier choice for ERP solutions.</p>
            <p>
                The first step in accomplishing our aim is to create a minimum viable product. This will involve
                designing and creating a small collection of products that we can then build on and expand, as well as
                setting up some strong foundations with cloud based architecture so that future development and
                deployment can be as seamless as possible not only for our customers, but for us.
            </p>
            <p>
                After completing this we move on to the next goal of securing our first customers. We will conduct
                market research to find and identify the businesses that not only will help us build on our vision, but
                businesses that our collection will also help grow. Through these first integrations and solutions we
                will do some intensive monitoring and testing to make sure the customers are happy with the product, as
                well as ensuring we are ready for market. Our first customers will be a vital part of a business, and
                without them we would not be able to progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                With our new customer base, although limited, we will be able to get feedback on what other applications
                or software tools they're using (or would like to use) to run their business. With this feedback
                combined with even further market research, we will be able to continue our development on the suite and
                reach our goal of increasing our product offering. With the insight of the actual users, expanding our
                product range is critical for our growth as well as theirs.
            </p>
            <p>
                As development continues and we continue to add product and test it with our existing users, we will
                also be able to market the product to new users. Whilst having the smaller offering might have got us
                started, the additional software and functionality we continue to add will help us reach new areas. By
                this point we will also need to consider having a dedicated customer support team offering not only
                technical service but providing quality customer support that we will pride ourselves on. We want to
                grow, and we really want our customers to grow as well, so getting customer experience right will be an
                absolute priority that will reward us greatly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final hurdle that will help us become the ultimate ERP for all businesses, is profitability. We know
                the product will be a hit, but we also know it will take some time before we're bringing in profit. With
                a strong economic strategy, investing in the product and the people who support it, with a strong profit
                we will be able to ensure we can offer a product, and price, to customers that will catapult us to the
                top of the market.
            </p>
            <!-- Service -->
            <i style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">The Service</i>
            <p>The Insignia Collection is an ERP software suite, offering businesses of all sizes a wide range of
                applications that are can be fully integrated with each other without the need for overcomplicated
                setup. This is Software as a Service, and will require a monthly or annual subscription. Due to the aim
                of modularity and affordability, customers are able to purchase subscriptions for individual products or
                bundles of applications, or the entire collection. The service will provide a secure backend
                infrastructure hosted on Azure infrastructure which will be explained further below. This will give us
                the ability to service customers from any location in the world with the lowest latency possible,
                however it does also mean the customer will be reliant on an online connection, and we will be heavily
                reliant on the uptime of the infrastructure provider.
                <br /><br />
                When a customer purchases their first application subscription, an environment for their data will be
                created. With this environment, all of the applications in the suite will be able to interface with each
                as a web hook on the databases will notify the applications whenever relevant information has been
                updated. After the first purchase, a portal will be available online providing the customer an admin
                portal, providing a dashboard with information about their services and their business information. The
                customer will be able to add their own employees through this platform, allowing them to self-manage who
                has access to their applications, and even who has access to certain functionality within the
                applications.
            </p>
            <!-- Infrastructure -->
            <h3>Cloud Infrastructure and Database Design</h3>
            <details>
                <summary>Cloud Infrastucture</summary>
                <p>The infrastructure that will be implemented for the Insignia suite of applications will be cloud
                    based. This will allow for the advantages outlined below:
                <ul>
                    <li>Greater flexibility to scale out as the business grows </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cloud based server architecture allows for a scalable model where the infrastructure can be
                            small at first, and then increase in size dynamically as the business user grows </li>
                        <li>Onsite based infrastructure in comparison forces the business to scope the size of the
                            prospective business at a point later in time.
                            If the business does not use the capabilities of the infrastructure, it is a waste of money.
                            If the business outgrows the capabilities of the infrastructure, there will be a costly
                            upgrade process.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>CAPEX vs OPEX cost model </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Capital expenditure forces the business to pay for the upfront costs of procuring the
                            infrastructure at the outset. </li>
                        <li>Operational expenditure allows the renting of the infrastructure so that the costs are
                            smaller upfront and gradually increase over time as the business grows </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Maintenance efficiency gains </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As the cloud service provider is responsible for the architecture depending on the service
                            model chosen. It allows Insignia to take advantage of the provider’s expertise to maintain
                            the hardware, platform or software. For example, the Azure SQL provides an Azure SQL managed
                            instance where the provider maintains the hardware, operating system and Azure SQL. In
                            short, it is a fully managed service. It allows Insignia to focus on the applications, data
                            and the business.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Security</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We can leverage the expertise of Microsoft to maintain and keep secure the security of the
                            infrastructure. </li>
                        <li>Although Insignia may seek the services of a security expert, the fact that Microsoft will
                            maintain the cloud infrastructure allows a large part of the security overhead to be the
                            responsibility of the provider. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Performance</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Due to the datacentre hardware available, the performance possibilities is much greater than
                            almost all single businesses can provide individually. </li>
                        <li>Services such as load balancing, allows multiple servers to provide business applications
                            the ability to perform as well as when 1 user uses it, vs 1000 or 1,000,000. </li>
                        <li>Infrastructure available for high performance computing, such as networking, compute and
                            storage allow a great degree of scale. </li>
                        <li>Microsoft Azure has datacentres across the world. This allows for greater performance, reach
                            and low latency for customers all around the world. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Resiliency</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Resiliency means that in the case of rain, hail or shine, the service needs to be working
                            24/7. </li>
                        <li>In the case of cloud services, it can be designed that in the event of hardware failure, a
                            failover or redundancy is implemented, ready to handle the load of the business services.
                        </li>
                        <li>Microsoft Azure has the resources to provide services globally. </li>
                        <li>Within the Australia region, there are 3 regions available. Of which there are 3
                            availability zones to allow for service continuity even in the case of a catastrophic force
                            majeure event at any of the sites. Ie. Earthquake, flood etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                    the
                    cloud provider. Insignia is responsible for the applications that run on it.</p>
                <p>The SQL server within the resource group is insignia-sql. It is classified as database as a service
                    (DBaaS). This means the servers, networking, storage and software is maintained by the cloud
                    provider.
                    Insignia is responsible for the SQL Server configuration such as the database and table design and

                    A modern HR system can benefit an organisation and individuals. It is widely recognised that the
                    most important asset an organisation has are it’s individuals. Empowering individuals, teams and
                    making the most of them allows an organisation to gain the most productivity and stability possible.
                    HR systems can assist and enhance the management of employees from onboarding to personal
                    development that aids the employees and organisation in the long term.
                </p>
                <p> A 2019 report from Sierra-Cedar, showed that in a survey of 1,892 organisations, with 22.2 million
                    employees, showed that there was an increase of 20% of respondents who view HR functions as
                    contributing strategic value, with executives 25% more likely to view HR as strategic compared to HR
                    directors or managers.The value of a HR system relies in on its efficacy and enabling an easy to use
                    and empowering system that integrates all elements of an individuals path to grow with the company.
                    Forrester Research ‘found that only 41% of global software decision makers say they’re satisfied
                    with existing HCM products’, while ‘56% are looking at alternate products’. More than 70% of
                    companies in the Sierra-Cedar report had already deployed at least 1 cloud HR application, and the
                    new buyers expect a software as a service / cloud option. </p>
                <p>Of note in Figure 17 below, is the 59% increase Talent Management spending and 35% increase in HR
                    Business Intelligence spending. This is extracted from the 41% of organisations polled that are
                    increasing their HR technology spend. </p>
                <img src="./media/fig17.png" style="width: 60%; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto; display: block;" />
                <p>The Insignia HR application module will be an integrated, self contained and all in one application
                    that services the Human Resources needs of an organisation. It will allow efficiency gains
                    throughout the end to end business processes. Some examples include the integration with Payroll,
                    POS and the rest of the ecosystem so that it allows efficient running of a business without time
                    consuming duplication of data. </p>
                <p>Many different functions are available in the HR module. The various functions will be organised into
                    modules. The application map is shown in Appendix 1 below. It will allow the onboarding of a new
                    employee and chart their course through time and organisational changes. It will allow the growth of
                    the individual, through measures such as Education, Promotions, and Performance narratives. In
                    addition to this, it will follow the industry laws, regulations and guidelines in terms of
                    employment hours, tracking timesheets, and allow the posting of OH&S documentation, company
                    policies, and job vacancies. Leave application, approvals and tracking history with leave balance
                    calculations are part and parcel of the core system. As the functions are broad, there will be a
                    discussion on the licensing scheme. Potentially there can be a base HR license, modular licenses for
                    functions and full feature system license. </p>

                <p>
                    In a report released 21st June 2022 by the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals, it was
                    noted that business inventories dropped but the costs of storage and handling increased, e-commerce
                    sales grew, and trucking freight continued to see more volume and opportunities. This highlights
                    that businesses need to ensure they have a complete solution when it comes to the management of
                    their inventory and logistics, and this is where the Insignia Inventory & Logistics management
                    software comes in. Our full featured application can help a business manage every aspect of their

                    delivery partners, clients can have peace of mind that all incoming or outgoing freight can be

                    levels in real time when items are received in or are incoming, being sent out, or reserved in a
                    pending transaction/order to ensure you always know exactly what your inventory looks like. The As a
                    standalone application, the Insignia Inventory and Logistics management software will take care of
                    everything such as inventory management, order management, warehouse management, freight management
                    and transport planning, stock projection and forecasting, order picking and packing. It can be
                    connected to a client’s e-commerce space so that their website has access to their stock
                    availability, and orders can be easily fulfilled without needing any manual input between the two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When combined with other programs in our application suite, a client will be able to expand the
                    abilities of this software. When used with our POS software they will have a fully connected system
                    that will allow items to be easily ordered in for a customer if its currently not in stock. With
                    full access to see what stock is available, where it can be ordered from, or even expected freight
                    times a client will be able to take full advantage of our POS system. Coupled with our accounting
                    software, a client can easily have supplier invoices loaded for payment or have purchase orders
                    created to place orders. Forecasting and stock projections can be used with our HR software to
                    ensure that staffing requirements are planned accordingly, or used with our CRM software to assist
                    in marketing campaign timeframes.<br />The Insignia Inventory and Logistics management software is a
                    must have for businesses that want an easy to use, feature packed program that can look after all

                <p>
                    The Point Of Sale system offered in the Insignia collection is feature packed and can be used as a
                    standalone application or combined with our other software offerings to increase its abilities. With
                    its robust features, the Insignia Point of Sale software can suit almost any business, and with its
                    intuitive design it will enable clients to efficiently process sales. A report by Grand View
                    Research (2020) found that the global POS market was valued at USD 9.26 billion in 2020 and was
                    expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 9.5% from 2021-2028. This report also showed that
                    fixed POS systems make up more than 55% of the POS market revenue. We believe that our Point of Sale
                    software, with its competitive pricing, will enable us to break into this growing market.

                <p>
                    As a standalone program, the Insignia POS system will enable clients to not only process
                    sales/returns, but search items to get details about them for their customers. Clients will have the
                    ability to add information to each item in their product library so staff can search it to find
                    specific information on them. Clients can allow their customers to choose multiple methods of
                    payment per sale, so a bill could be split or paid for using cash and card. To make cash handling
                    easier the software will display the change to be given when an employee enters how much was
                    tendered. In the case of split payments, the system will require all chosen methods to add up to the
                    total so that there is no risk of over/undercharging a customer. A receipt/tax invoice will be
                    produced for every sale and can be either printed or emailed to customer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clients can also save basic customer information in the POS system so reservations can be made, or
                    special orders/pre-orders can be placed. Using our CRM software a client can expand greatly on the
                    information they can gather and what they are able to do with this information. Receipts/tax
                    invoices, order history and any loyalty program information can be saved to a customer’s account
                    using the POS and CRM software together.

                <p>
                    When linked with our inventory and logistics management system, it will allow the client to see
                    stock on hand, incoming stock, stock available in their warehouse, stock at their other sites or
                    whether the item is discontinued or just unavailable. This integration will also allow stock figures
                    to be updated live across all sites and warehouses when sales are processed or replenishment stock
                    orders are made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When combined with our accounting software, clients will have the ability to attribute a sale to a
                    customer’s account for invoicing. This software will also make it easier for a client to manage GST
                    or other relevant taxes, and easily reconcile all sales and accounts. While the POS software will be
                    able to create simple sales reports, combining it with the accounting software will allow detailed
                    sales reports to be generated that can include any number criteria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a client has our HR software, they will be able to review detailed sales data and reports for
                    each employee they have enrolled in the POS system. This is especially helpful for any client that
                    requires this information for employee KPIs.

                    The market for point of sale systems is quite varied which is why the Insignia POS will be able to
                    be customised to suit multiple business models. The report from Grand View Research (2020) shows
                    that the businesses that make up the largest share of the Point of Sale software market are
                    restaurants, hospitality (hotels etc.), healthcare, retail, warehouses and entertainment. The core
                    of our application will remain the same, but the interface can be changed to suite the business that
                    it will be deployed in. Upon initial launch the POS system will mainly focus on retail and
                    restaurant settings, however further updates will be made to allow the POS software to work
                    seamlessly in any number of industries.

                <p>
                    While the payroll system may not be part of the first rollout it will be a core application of our
                    core application. The payroll system offered my Insignia will be a simple set up process and haste
                    free using it will one of several apps that Insignia has to offer. The process is really simple as
                    you get a new employee you fill out all the employee’s details and it’s stored on our cloud based
                    service which you can have access to at any time when you need it. The payroll system does all the
                    hard work for you once the employee has entered in their hrs of work for the day or week how ever
                    you would like to have it set up, you will be able to see how much everyone has worked so far for
                    that week and how much their will be getting paid. The employee can check with limited access to see
                    how many hrs they have worked for that week also see how much annual leave, sick leave and long
                    service leave they have and can also request time off or any other days off they need thru the app.
                    It can calculate wages, taxes and super contributions all in the one system. Doing payroll can be a
                    nightmare and a big job that’s why we offer a simple easy way to do pays our direct deposits systems
                    lets you do the weekly payroll and which one touch of the button it gets directly deposited into
                    people’s bank accounts. You will be able to generate reports based on several filters depending on
                    your choice either day or week to see how much of your profit is going towards pays, see how much
                    leave people have, sick days left and super contributions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your new to the payroll world or are a little bit scared that you might be in over your head, we
                    offer support to all our clients if they need to just get things up and running or any issues, they
                    come across that they can’t fix.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it’s integrated with our apps it will greatly improve by our other supporting applications it
                    will be able to talk to the account applications at the end of, they day you can see how much money
                    you have spent of wages vs how much profit you made on that day to see if you need more people on or
                    less. A lot of companies outsource they payroll to other software and service providers it has risen
                    8% over from 24% in 2018 to 32% in 2019 according (to the 2019 payroll benchmarking report ) it
                    makes sense to free up time inside the business and anyone who was working on it at the time as it’s
                    not a core functions of their operations but here at Insinga we offer a very simple and quick
                    payroll system that puts your mind at ease with a few click here and here and payroll is done

                <summary><u>Accounting</u></summary>
                <p>
                    Whilst the accounting software will not be available in our early access previews, it will be a core
                    component to our application line up. In a study by Mordor Intelligence (2021), demand and growth
                    for accounting software is predicted to be the highest in the local Asia-Pacific market. By creating
                    a feature rich application that can work as a standalone application or as a key component in an
                    integrated environment, we anticipate that we will be able to ride the momentum of the growth and
                    position ourselves with firm footings in the market. As a standalone application, customers will be
                    able to use the application to completely manage and control their finances. Customers will be able
                    to see their cashflow and create budget summaries allowing them to plan their finances. There will
                    be an option to create a stylised report of theses summaries containing the customers letterhead and
                    all of the relevant information which can be printed or exported to PDF to be emailed. Submitting
                    and paying invoices from suppliers and service providers will also be possible through the software,
                    allowing the customer to keep digital records of everything and use the information from the invoice
                    to work out things like how much tax has to be held or paid, and which accounts the money is coming
                    from. Even setting up payment terms per supplier will be possible, so that invoices can be processed
                    the most efficiently. The software will also feature automatic bank reconciliation to remove the
                    extra work. The software will also allow for the import and export of data so that it can be given
                    to other accounting services, or so that customers in the financial sector can work on data provided
                    to them from other software. To keep costs down 41% of small business owners tend to do all of the
                    accounting on their own (Brown 2019), by providing all of this functionality we are able to approach
                    a huge market and provide powerful tools to reduce their workloads.
                </p>
                <img src="./media/accountpre.png"
                    style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block; width: 60%;" />
                <p>
                    In an integrated environment, the accounting software will still have all of this functionality
                    however it will also be greatly improved by its supporting applications. With the payroll
                    application for example, the accounting software will be able to see the roster and provide real
                    time updates to the budgets. With this integration the accounting software will also be keep track
                    of PAYG taxes and any other relevant payments like HELP fees. When sharing an environment with the
                    inventory management application, invoices can be held until they are considered received to ensure
                    goods were delivered. If the customer is using the point of sale software, each sales invoice can
                    credit and debit the correct accounts automatically reducing the manual work required. All of these
                    modular options enable the customer to fully create an environment tailored to them, providing them
                    with the functionality they need to reduce the complexity in not only the configuration of the
                    software, but also the overall operation of their entire business all without huge overheads.

            <p><u>Limitations</u><br /><br />
                Programmatic:<br />Within the ERP application framework, limitations will include all updates will only
                fix
                issues until the next feature update which is scheduled bi-annually. Major versions ie. V1 to V2 will
                include new features and framework changes. Customisations for large clients will incur additional
                maintenance costs.<br /><br />
                Legal:<br /> All data from the region will be held within the regional datacentre. All data will be
                encrypted
                so that Insignia will not be able to read data. No governmental access. EULA will be available within
                the application. As the EULA can be changed dynamically. <br /><br />
                Liabilities:<br /> Limited liability for Insignia. SLA breaches of downtime will incur reduction of fees
                but
                will not incur damages. Loss of data may incur additional damages and will only be at the highest tier
                subscription. However, triple redundancy and backups will only be provided for the highest tier
                subscription.

            <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
            <p>The Insignia Collection will be built on and depend of a wide range of tools and technologies. From open
                source software, to cloud based hardware. Whilst the Insignia Collection will begin it's life relatively
                simple, there is a plan to remove some of these third party dependencies and replace them with in house
                solutions where possible. Below you'll find the list of these tools as well as the experience some group
                members may have had with them.

            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p><u>Software Testing</u><br />
                An important part of application is unit testing, which by definition is the process of individually
                testing the functions and methods within an application to ensure they operate as intended at all times.
                As explained by Thomas Hamilton (2022), by conducting proper unit testing starts and
                continues from the beginning of development it saves time and money by reducing errors within the life
                cycle of the software. Fortunately, since we plan to develop the application in C# and use Visual Studio
                2022, we have access to some great unit testing functionality within the IDE. Through our early start
                and continued efforts with unit testing we will be able to test every part of functional code before it
                makes it to production. As well as unit testing, we will also have the following procedures:
            <ul>
                <li>Code Review</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Code reviews should be incorporated by multiple developers and teams (when the development team
                        surpasses 5). This will allow independent analysis and review.</li>
                    <li>Regular development meetings should be scheduled to review current status and issues and to
                        allow discussion of topics to focus. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Testing Methodolody</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unit testing should involve automated test scripts where possible </li>
                    <li>The test scripts themselves should be reviewed according to schedule and updated as required
                    </li>
                    <li>Specific testing using unexpected data types, lengths, and behaviours should be performed to try
                        and break the code </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Code Stability</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Testing individual code fragments to ensure it behaves in a consistent and expected manner </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use breakpoints to isolate bugs </li>
                        <li>Ensure the data type is aligned with the specific function </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Testing the interoperability of code modules </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ensure the data is processed correct and does not allow buffer overflows </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Testing the data is consistent within the single application </li>
                    <li>Testing the data flows from one application to another </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Code Stability</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Review code and data inputs that may be vulnerable to buffer overflows </li>
                    <li>Review Github and Microsoft knowledge bases to track known security vulnerabilities within
                        libraries and frameworks</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Code Efficiency</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Review code to ensure that the function is as efficient as possible while being legible </li>
                    <li>Inefficient code is often difficult to understand and trace the data flow within the function
                    </li>
                    <li>Create polymorphic if possible to allow re-use of code </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure the profiling of code for each code fragment and module </li>
                    <li>Ensure the data transactions from the code to the database is as efficient as possible </li>
                    <li>Review SQL logs to ensure no inefficient SQL is passed to SQL Server </li>
                    <li>Review Database performance and statistics to identify and resolve DB issues before they become
                        critical </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Testing should be performed outside of the IDE using the real application </li>
                    <li>Testing and Dev environments should be available to run the code using up to date and accurate
                        data </li>
                    <li>Pilot releases for customer submitted change requests need to pass User Acceptance Testing
                        (UAT). </li>
                    <li>This needs to be managed and monitored to identify issues before the general release of the code

            <h2>Group Proccess and Communications</h2>
            <p>For this assignment and the last one we have set up Microsoft teams as a point of communication between
                everyone in the group. We can post topics in the chat and upload files to the server where everyone can
                view and edit them on the go which has been useful over the assignment. We have a weekly meeting set up
                for every Tuesday around 9pm Melbourne time where we have a meeting agenda set for that meeting which is
                sent out before the meeting that gives us a idea of what everyone is going to talk about and so on. If
                we have a group member that isn’t responding to communications, we will reach out and ask them “hey is
                everything alright just to make sure that are going well we all understand that personal life can get in
                the way of study. </p>
            <p>We all try and come to these weekly meetings as its very important part of the group to talk about issues
                or just things that need to be done for that week. the meetings normally go for like an hour maybe more
                if we have a lot to talk about. We are all active on the group chat within teams everybody responds to
                each other’s posts about what they said. </p>
