        <h1>Adam Greenwood's Career Plan</h1>
        <p>As I am writing this, I am starting my job in a completely different area of the work force I am leaving my
            fast food work place that I have been at for the past 15 years to go work in a hardware warehouse. As this
            course was the first time, I have done any studying since leaving school I have learnt a lot about myself
            and what I want to do with my career. I still want to get into the system administrator role at some point.
            I have learnt more then I even knew about thru this course </p>
        <ul>
            System Administrator responsibilities can include:
            <li>Installing and configuring software, hardware and networks. </li>
            <li>Monitoring system performance and troubleshooting issues. </li>
            <li>Set up accounts and workstations</li>
            <li>Upgrade systems with new releases and models </li>
        </ul>
