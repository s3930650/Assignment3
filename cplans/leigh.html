        <h1>Leigh White's Career Plan</h1>
        <h3>Software Developer</h3>
        <p>My career has taken a few turns, especially in recent times. I would have told you at the beginning of the
            unit I would keep on studying and working in my previous career until I learned more about the industry and
            ultimately would like to see myself working in software development. During the course however, the
            opportunity arose for me to start my career in the IT industry and now my career plans are in shambles.
            <br /><br />
            I plan to continue my studies online as only one of the reasons to study was to pursue a career, the other
            was to pursue my interest in education on the subject. I’ve always been around IT and would like to be
            formally recognised for the impact it’s had on my life. In the next few years I’ll continue my current role
            in web hosting/server management, but I will also keep programming and try to develop a pathway into
            becoming a software developer like I have always wanted to. With the support of an education from RMIT as
            well as my current employer, I believe this is definitely and achievable goal.
        </p>

                                Successfully progress with my studies

                                Learn as much as I can about web hosting to use that information to be a better
                                developer
                            </li>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Learn more about the technical operations of an IT company to further understand the
                                hardware process
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Complete my studies
                            </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Having completed my studies and hopefully working in the industry for +5 years I would
                                like to be developing at this point. Either freelance, contract based, or in a team.
