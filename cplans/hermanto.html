            <h3>Current skills, knowledge, and experience </h3>
            <p>I gained the Prince2 Practitioner certification in 2017. <br />
                I also have skills in SQL, communication, project management and general IT analysis and investigation.
                <br />
                I have knowledge of different IT aspects as well, SQL Server T-SQL, Oracle PL SQL, Linux and many modern
                office applications. <br />
                I have over 10 years in Project Management, Implementations and being a subject matter expert in the
                field.<br />
                In addition to further experience supporting Oracle systems, Linux and Windows infrastructure.
            </p>
            <h3>Skills required or needing development </h3>
            <p>I will need more managerial skills and knowledge. <br />
                I will require certifications in team communication, management and also business management via an MBA
                or similar. <br />
                Strategies to communicate and manage different people is an aspect that is important in the modern
                age.<br />
                As well as negotiation and strategic business skills.</br>
                I believe a mixture of courses and active learning on the job will assist in acquiring the development I
                need to go forward in my career.
