        <h3>Systems Administrator</h3>
        <ul>
            My ideal job is a System Administrator. The role of a System Administrator can involve a wide number of
            things such as:
            <li>Installing and configuring software, hardware and networks. </li>
            <li>Monitoring system performance and troubleshooting issues. </li>
            <li>Set up accounts and workstations</li>
            <li>Upgrade systems with new releases and models </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Within 1 year goal</th>
                    <th>2-5 Year goal</th>
                    <th>5+ Year goal</th>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Complete some certifications that will help me in getting an IT role (e.g. Microsoft
                                Azure Fundamentals or an ITIL certification)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Gain an entry level role within the IT industry
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Progress within my role in the IT industry or use it to gain another position that is
                                closer to my goal.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Complete my university studies and use what I have learnt along with my experiences to
                                get a system administrator role.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>

        <div>
            <h3>Current skills, knowledge, and experience </h3>
            <p>I studied Information Technology for my HSC and have been working on completing the Microsoft Azure
                Fundamentals certification. I also have plans on completing more certifications to expand my current
                skill set. I have a good general knowledge of IT and in my role at work I look after most of the IT
                related items at our site. I previously worked at Dick Smith Electronics for 2 years where I did most of
                the troubleshooting, fixing basic problems, and setup of computers in the store I worked at. </p>
            <h3>Skills required or needing development </h3>
            <p>The System Administrator role requires a Bachelor of Information Technology, Computer Science or Systems
                Management which is why I am studying the Bachelor of Information Technology. By completing this degree
                and doing smaller certifications along the way I will be able to increase my knowledge and hopefully
                gain some experience while doing this. The Bachelor of Information Technology covers off a lot of the
                things that the System Administrator role does which will mean I will have a sound knowledge to work off
                when trying to get this role. </p>
