            Microsoft teams was the platform we all choose to use to work on this group assignment. We have learnt from
            the last assignment and have set up agendaâ€™s every week and a few running posts of things that we need to
            do. One thing that was surprising to me that there was always help available even though we are all spread
            out across Australia with different time zones and unexpected things popped up we all wore there for each
            other.

            We chose well when using Microsoft Teams as a medium for group work. It worked well on this assignment
            because we started with good practices that we learnt from the last assignment. We could have used the
            messenger side of Microsoft Teams a bit more because we left most of the communication to our weekly team
            meetings. What was surprising to me was that even though we are spread across Australia, we formed a
            supportive and cohesive team that produced this assignment to a high quality.

            The group work for assignment 3 felt a little harder to me than it did for assignment 2. I think that in the
            end things finally started coming together but it did feel like a challenge to get all the pieces of this
            project together. The communication of the group could definitely be improved. Not all team members were as
            active in the group as others which did present some challenges in organising for tasks to be completed.
            This also meant that the workload was not always distributed evenly as some team members took on additional
            tasks that had not yet been completed. Our team meetings were generally productive, with those present
            putting ideas forward, reviewing current progress and setting goals for the following week. Despite the
            challenges that come with group work, I was surprised at the quality of work we have been able to achieve. I
            think that we have a solid idea and have made some good progress on it since assignment 2. One thing I have
            learned from group work is that it is important to make sure that there is a strong lead, and everyone is
            given equal chance to contribute. I think we did this well by discussing it at the very beginning of our
            group work and laying out a schedule and structure for the rest of the project.

            The group synergy was improved compared to assignment 2. This allowed communication to be more fluent and
            natural in general. And made for a more open discussion where better ideas and constructive criticism
            enabled better decisions in the end. As each individual had their own constraints, some examples include
            work and family commitments, some of the tasks were not completed in accord with the original desired
            timeframes. One thing that was surprising was the camaraderie that was established in such little time. One
            thing that I have learned about groups is though we are a diverse group of people, almost all of us are
            driven to a common goal.

            This time around the group work was definitely more challenging. Whilst we had the idea of what we wanted to
            do, I think a lot of time was spent on producing artefacts instead of developing the content and structure
            for the body of work. It was also just difficult as well as there were unforeseen circumstances that
            impacted some users. From the group meetings it felt like we were on the right path, but coming up to the
            deadline it became apparent that there were further obstacles we had to overcome. However some group members
            were able to pick up extra work and really played as the perfect group members, putting their hand up to
            help out wherever possible without being prompted. Having such a diverse group as well really created a
            space where ideas could be challenged and worked at from different angles until we could come to a
            conclusion. It was rare that an idea was perfect from the start, but through the group process we could
            shape it to be. As challenging as it was, it was still a great experience to work with some talented people.
